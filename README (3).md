## Project Overview

The Loan Eligibility Prediction Model is a machine learning application that determines whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on input features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, etc. The prediction model has been trained on historical loan data.

## Files in the Repository

- `app.py`: The main application script that runs the web server and handles prediction requests.
- `Loan Eligibility Prediction Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model.pkl`: The serialized pre-trained machine learning model used for making predictions.
- `Dataset/Data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
- `static/style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web application.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the application's input form.
- `templates/result.html`: The HTML template for displaying the prediction results.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-eligibility-prediction.git
    cd loan-eligibility-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that the web server is running by executing `python app.py`.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Enter the required loan application details in the form provided.
4. Submit the form to receive the loan eligibility prediction.

## Model Details

The machine learning model used in this project is a [type of model, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.], trained on a dataset containing various features related to loan applicants. The model was trained using the steps outlined in the `Loan Eligibility Prediction Model.ipynb` notebook.

### Key Features Used in the Model:

- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Property Area
- And others...
